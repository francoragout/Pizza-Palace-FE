Hello and welcome to my final project of the Rolling Code School full-stack course, which is about a virtual menu of a restaurant where the user registers and places their orders through the web app, the user can also see the status of his order. The administrator updates the orders required by the user and performs them, it should also be noted that the administrator not only has full control over the orders, there are also the users who can activate and deactivate their accounts, they can also modify, add and delete the menus.

Before starting...
